JTools
======

This mod defines a few basic tools for managing the world.
This is a very small mod that doesn't do a whole lot.
If you want something better, use Worldedit instead.

Destructionator
---------------

This is a tool that forcibly removes all entities and nodes. Players are killed.

Property Editor
---------------

Allows for a player to edit an entity's contained data.
Currently only supports editing strings, numbers, and booleans.

Positioning tool
----------------

Offers fine grained control over the orientation of an entity.
An entity's position, health, rotation, and velocity can be modified.
