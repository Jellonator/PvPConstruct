PvP Construct
=============
Version 1.0
Created by Jellonator

What is this?
-------------
This is a set of mods created to aid in the creation of minigames,
specifically PvP games. Many of these mods are based off of popular multiplayer
games such as DOTA, Team Fortress 2, Overwatch, Counter Strike, etc.

Mods bundled with this subgame
------------------------------
Every mod has its own function and are separated for organization.

### scoreboard
Adds teams to the game. Players on the same team can not harm each other.
Teams must compete to complete objectives to win.

### team_fort
A mod based on Team Fortess 2; provides many tf2-style utilities, such as
health packs, ammo boxes, payloads, etc.

### clicky_signs
Adds signs that can be clicked to activate commands on a player

TODO
----
As with any mod, there is so much to do and so much to see. Here I will compile
a list of generally what and where this mod is going.

 - Team spawns/respawning (scoreboard/team_fort)
 - Healthpacks (team_fort)
 - Ammo packs (team_fort)
 - Classes
 - Class selection formspec
