PvP Construct
=============
Version 1.0.0
Created by Jellonator

What is this?
-------------
This is a set of mods created to aid in the creation of minigames,
specifically PvP games. Many of these mods are based off of popular multiplayer
games such as DOTA, Team Fortress 2, Overwatch, Counter Strike, etc.

Please note that this mod is currently in beta. Use at your own risk, and make
sure to keep backups of your worlds. Some of these mods, especially team_fort
and objectively, don't work very well in other subgames.

Mods bundled with this subgame
------------------------------
Every mod has its own function and are separated for organization. Mods listed
here are in order of dependency, with most dependent mods placed at the bottom.
Mods in this subgame are designed to be as independent as possible while still
providing functionality between them. For example, mods like 'status_effects'
and 'designer_weapons' can function without the bloat of, say, 'objectively'
and 'team_fort' ( although jutil would still need to be included with them ).

### jutil
Set of utilities used by most every mod in this subgame.

### jtools
Set of in-game tools used for manipulating the world. Not intended for large
scale world modification, install worldedit for that.

### status_effects
Adds status effects to the game. More about status effects can be read at
'mods/status_effects/README.md'.

### teammake
Adds teams to the game. Players on the same team can not harm each other.
Teams must compete to complete objectives to win.

### objectively
Adds objectives to the game. An objective defines a goal that players need to
achieve. More about it can be found under 'mods/objectively/README.md'.

### clicky_signs
Adds signs that can be clicked to activate commands on a player

### designer_weapons
Mod that adds functions for defining weapons. This mod is intended for use by
other mods, yet it also defines a small set of default weapons.

### caste
A mod that adds classes to the game.

### team_fort
A mod based on Team Fortess 2; provides many tf2-style utilities, such as
health packs, ammo boxes, payloads, etc.

TODO
----
As with any mod, there is so much to do and so much to see. Here I will compile
a list of generally what and where this mod is going.

 - More weapons and abilities
 - team_fort classes
