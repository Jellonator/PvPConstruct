PvP Construct
=============
Version 1.0
Created by Jellonator

What is this?
-------------
This is a set of mods created to aid in the creation of minigames,
specifically PvP games. Many of these mods are based off of popular multiplayer
games such as DOTA, Team Fortress 2, Overwatch, Counter Strike, etc.

Please note that this mod is currently nowhere near complete. There is still a
lot of work to be done. As such, it is currently recommended to *not* download
this mod unless you plan on contributing, or if it does get complete and I
forget to remove this notice from the readme. The only reason this is on github
is so that I can sync this project between my laptop and desktop.

Mods bundled with this subgame
------------------------------
Every mod has its own function and are separated for organization. Mods listed
here are in order of dependency, with most dependent mods placed at the bottom.

### jutil
Set of utilities used by most every mod in this subgame.

### jtools
Set of in-game tools used for manipulating the world. Not intended for large
scale world modification, install worldedit for that.

### status_effects
Adds status effects to the game. More about status effects can be read at
'mods/status_effects/README.md'.

### teammake
Adds teams to the game. Players on the same team can not harm each other.
Teams must compete to complete objectives to win.

### clicky_signs
Adds signs that can be clicked to activate commands on a player

### designer_weapons
Mod that adds functions for defining weapons. This mod is intended for use by
other mods, yet it also defines a small set of default weapons.

### team_fort
A mod based on Team Fortess 2; provides many tf2-style utilities, such as
health packs, ammo boxes, payloads, etc.

TODO
----
As with any mod, there is so much to do and so much to see. Here I will compile
a list of generally what and where this mod is going.

 - Classes
 - Class selection formspec
 - Objectives (timer, payload, control points)
